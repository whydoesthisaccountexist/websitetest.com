    <h1>The Science of Life (Chapter 1)</h1>
    <h2>Themes of Biology</h2>
    <h4>
      Scientists estimate that 40 million species of organisms inhabit the
      Earth.
    </h4>
    <h4>
      But 2 million out of 40 million have been identified and named, and only a
      few thousand have been studied in ANY detail.
    </h4>
    <h4>
      But, alot of the world of biology remains to be explored and studied.
    </h4>
    <h4>
      The good news is that there are guideposts to help chart a course through
      this world. These guideposts are like themes that unify biology.
    </h4>
    <h4>
      in this chapter, you will read about unifying biology themes that allow
      biologists to study the large diversity of life.
    </h4>
    <h2>The Study of Life</h2>
    <h4>
      The first life form probaly arose the Earth more than 3.5 billion years
      ago. Much evidence suggests that this first organism or living thing was a
      SINGLE cell, too small to be seen without the aid of a microscope.
    </h4>
    <h4>
      For millions of years, single-celled organisms floating in the seas was
      the only life on Earth. No fish swam the oceans, no birds flew through the
      skys, and no snakes moved across the ground.
    </h4>
    <h4>
      Over time, organisms changed. New kinds of organisms arose the Earth from
      older kinds and came to inhabit almost every region of the Earth.
    </h4>
    <h4>
      Today, brilliantly colored birds glide through the trees of tropical rain
      forests. Odd-looking fish prowl in the dark depths of the oceans, emitting
      a strange red light that helps them locate their prey.
    </h4>
    <h4>
      Giant sequoia trees tower over hundreds of feet above the ferns growing on
      forest floors.
    </h4>
    <h4>
      Nearly blind moles burrow their ways underground searching for tiny
      insects to consume.
    </h4>
    <h4>
      These and millions types of organisms form the diverse population of
      Earth.
    </h4>
    <h4>Biology, The Science of Life is the study of all living things.</h4>
    <h4>
      Biology includes the study of microscopic structure of living cells. It
      also includes the study of microscopic interactions of millions of
      organisms.
    </h4>
    <h4>
      It includes the study of the life history of individual organisms as well
      as the collective history of all organisms.
    </h4>
    <h4>
      The science of biology is as varied as the organisms as the organisms that
      are its subjects.
    </h4>
    <h4>
      Biology is unified by certain themes, however, that come into play no
      matter what organism or what kind of.
